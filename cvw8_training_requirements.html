    <h1 id="cvw-8-training-requirements">CVW-8 Training Requirements</h1>
    <p>Below are the outlined training requirements. There are two types of certification you may hold: basic flight certification, and wingman certification. In order to be checked off on these certifications you must schedule a checkride with either the CAG or DCAG. These checkrides are not meant to be strict tests. You may always ask for help, and your instructor can walk you through certain steps. Once the instructor feels you are reasonably competent at the given task you may get it checked off. Instructors may also check you off during regular trainings if they see you demonstrate competency in a specific subject, even if a checkride was never scheduled.</p>
