    <h2 id="natops">NATOPS</h2>
    <p>The Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) manuals describe pretty much real world procedure regarding operation of the aircraft. If you ever want to delve into how things are done for real, or if you are looking for specific data such as performance data or trim settings for asymmetric loads, then this is a great place to start. There are also many helpful tables and figures.</p>

    <h2 id="chucks-guides">Chuck’s Guides</h2>
    <p>Chuck’s guides are always my starting point when someone is hopping into a jet for the first time. In particular, I find the sections that outline the controls needed to be very helpful when you don’t have any keybinds setup. However, these guides give a good overview of all the systems and functionality in a given aircraft, so they are a great read for anyone looking to become more familiar with an aircraft.</p>

    <h2 id="supercarrier-procedures">Supercarrier Procedures</h2>
    <p>As you might imagine, carrier procedures are an important part of being a naval squad, so all CVW-8 pilots are required to be familiar with basic carrier operations.</p>
    <h3 id="case-i">Case I</h3>
    <p>Case I operations take place when the following criteria are met:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>instrument conditions are not expected during departure and recovery,</li>
    <li>it is daytime,</li>
    <li>ceiling is greater than 3,000 ft,</li>
    <li>and visibility is greater than 5 nmi.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following video covers case I recovery</p>
    <h3 id="case-ii">Case II</h3>
    <p>Case II operations take place when:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>some instrument conditions may be encountered during departure or recovery,</li>
    <li>it is daytime,</li>
    <li>ceiling is greater than 1,000 ft,</li>
    <li>and visibility is greater than 5 nmi.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="case-iii">Case III</h3>
    <p>Case III operations take place when neither of the above criteria apply, so case III operations are used when:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>instrument conditions are expected during departure or recovery,</li>
    <li>it is night,</li>
    <li>ceiling is less than 1,000 ft,</li>
    <li>visibility is less than 5 nmi,</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="formation-procedures">Formation Procedures</h2>
    <p>Flying in formation is a critical part of any mission, but many different situations will call for different types of formation. Formation procedures are not easy to learn, and they take a lot of practice. While these videos and materials will outline the basics, the best way to learn is to practice a bunch until it becomes second nature. Note that the procedures outlined here focus mostly on the F/A-18C, and as such they may not be applicable in entirety to the F-14B.</p>
    <h3 id="formation-takeoff">Formation Takeoff</h3>
    <p>The most important part of formation takeoff is that the flight lead brief the takeoff procedure prior to it happening. Generally aircraft line up according to the pictures below.</p>
    <iframe width="80%" src="https://i.imgur.com/enDcLhg.png" frameborder="0">

    </iframe>
    <p>Upon being lined up, lead will give a cue to run up the engines, such as “run ’em up.” Engines are run up to approximately 80% indicated rpm. Lead will give a second cue such as “brakes, brakes, ready now” which indicates to release brakes and advance throttles to approximately military power minus 2% rpm.</p>
    <p>Afterburner may be used during formation takeoff if pre-briefed, but flight lead such not advance throttle to more than 50% afterburner; this allows room for adjustment by the wingmen.</p>
    <p>Once rolling down the runway takeoff proceeds as usual with lead giving additional cues for rotate, gear up, and flaps up. Turns should not be performed until at least 500 ft AGL.</p>
    <p>If multiple flight sections are taking off from the same point in the runway, then takeoff should be delayed by at least 10 seconds of separation.</p>
    <p>The following video may be useful in preparing for formation takeoff procedures.</p>

    <h3 id="formation-flying">Formation Flying</h3>
    <p>There are a few main types of formation flight procedures that are outlined here. Additionally the following video may be helpful; however, for specific guidance on formation flight, please see the respective NATOPS manual.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeqEaAwOGmY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>

    <h4 id="parade">Parade</h4>
    <p>Parade formation is an up close and personal type of formation, with wingmen in the hornet flying with only 4 ft of horizontal separation between each plane.</p>
    <iframe width="80%" src="https://i.imgur.com/vZOsQ74.png" frameborder="0">
    </iframe>
    <h4 id="cruise">Cruise</h4>
    <p>Cruise formation is a more relaxed formation that gives wingmen a “cone of maneuver” that allows them to shift around in formation to increase ability to keep visual situational awareness.</p>

    <h4 id="air-to-air-refueling">Air-to-air Refueling</h4>
    <p>Despite having a reputation for being one of the hardest maneuvers to perform successfully, air-to-air refueling is not much different from flying in formation. The trick is to master your formation flying skills, and then to find a fixed point on the tanker you can focus on (not the basket) that helps keep your alignment while making slight adjustments to stay in formation. The following video may help learning some techniques, but the best way to learn is to practice it a bunch.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rt6_UsUd_Zk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    <h3 id="formation-landing">Formation Landing</h3>
    <p>Formation landing follows much of the same procedures as formation takeoff, but they are done in reverse. The same rule applies that the most important aspect is to pre-brief the procedure. Lead will brief the landing procedure and give cues for flaps and gear. Once on the ground, each plane should decelerate individually; do not try to brake in section. Continue to maintain parade separation or greater as runway width allows.</p>

    <h2 id="sead">SEAD</h2>
    <p>SEAD and DEAD missions are crucial to many operations, and there is never a single way to do things that works for all scenarios. This guide will present two primary strategies that are useful in different situations.</p>
    <h3 id="using-standoff-weapons">Using Standoff Weapons</h3>
    <p>Using standoff weapons is a preferred strategy when dealing with high threat areas where getting close is not an option. It presents a way to engage targets from outside their primary threat range and has a higher chance to keep the pilot out of harms way. The primary downside is that many SAM sites are very effective at shooting down standoff weapons, and unless the site is flooded by launching many JSOWs/HARMs at the same time, few or no weapons may ever reach their targets.</p>
    <p>A key to any high threat mission like SEAD or DEAD is utilizing the defensive systems available on the aircraft. In particular utilizing chaff can help break radar lock, and ECM jamming can prevent being locked all together. The following video goes over the basics of ECM and countermeasure programs.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6TaSLxVGoM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    <p>The AGM-88C HARM in self protect (SP) mode allows a pilot to have other weapons selected, but upon being locked from a radar ground threat, receive a cue to automatically deploy the HARM towards the highest threat. Launching HARMs will often force SAM sites to turn off their radars in order to avoid being destroyed, and thus they prove to be a useful defensive tool. However, due to the ability for a SAM site to turn off its radar and thus make the HARM useless, HARMs are not the best tool if destroying the SAM site is a priority. Please see the following video for a guide on how to use HARMs with SP mode and utilize the SP OVERRIDE mode.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/amyGzVnr2oU?start=598" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    <p>Joint Standoff Weapons (JSOWs) are long range glide bombs with GPS guidance on board. The AGM-154A is a glide bomb containing cluster munitions while the C variant contains a large explosive and is capable of armor penetration. These weapons are good options for DEAD missions due to their large range and reduced radar cross section that makes it harder for SAM sites to destroy the bomb before it reaches its destination. In conjunction with a targeting pod such as the ATFLIR, JSOWs are able to be deployed on any target a pilot can visually spot through the TPOD by using target of opportunity (TOO) mode. Please see the following videos for guidance with JSOWs and the ATFLIR tpod.</p>

    <h3 id="wild-weasel">Wild Weasel</h3>
    <p>Wild weasel is a high risk and high reward strategy that gets pilots up close and personal with SAM sites. Utilizing terrain masking, pilots get as close as possible, avoiding radar contact and launches until they are within the minimum range of launch of the SAM site where they can safely pop up and engage the site. The major downside is the high risk nature of this type of attack. Getting even 10 ft too high can expose you to the radar and mean getting launched on; depending on the particular threat, this could be deadly. Many SAM sites also have close range defenses that make minimum engagement range effectively zero which makes this strategy especially high risk.</p>
    <p>The wild weasel strategy itself can employ a variety of different weapons such as HARMs, mavericks, retarded bombs, or even guns. The primary tactic employed is flying low and using terrain to mask your radar signature. Once close enough, pilots briefly pop up to deploy weapons. The following videos cover wild weasel strategy for different types of SAM threats.</p>
